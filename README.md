# TO DO

- Table of contents :
  - Change bullet points style
  - Add hypertext link : When the user click on an element he should be redirected to the correct article
- Change the articles' subtitles style
- Add an image slider
  - Done and hidden
  - It remains :
    - Add an event when clicking on the image to display the slider. I have the code but the promise handling in the Article content.js file is still blurry for me.
    - Give the correct params to the slider
    - Add an effect on hovering the photo to show that it is clickable
- Change the URL for articles, the spaces break the URL
